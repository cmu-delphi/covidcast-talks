# covidcast-talks
Presentations about the COVIDcast project.

## New presentation

To start a new presentation, copy the `template` folder and name your new folder descriptively. You can also look at any other folder for more detailed examples of the talks we've given.

Once done, you can run:

```
./cp-talk repo-name
```

where `repo-name` is the name of your new folder and it'll copy the file `repo-name/talk.html` will be copied over to new file `docs/repo-name.html`, which would then be viewable through GitHub docs.
